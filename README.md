# Image-Classification--Multiclass

Multiclass Image classification

Approach:- Deep Leaning 

Algorithm:- Convolutional Neural Network

classes are: Cat, Dog, Horse

A classification problem including more than two classes, such as classifying a series of dog breed photographs which may be a pug, bulldog, or teabetain mastiff. Multi-class classification assumes that each sample is assigned to one class, e.g. a dog can be either a breed of pug or a bulldog but not both simultaneously.

Many approaches are used to solve this problem, such as converting the N number of classes to N number binary columns representing each class. By doing so, we can use a binary classifier for Multi Classification problems. Pandas built-in get_dummies attribute provides you with   this functionality to get a binary representation of each class.
